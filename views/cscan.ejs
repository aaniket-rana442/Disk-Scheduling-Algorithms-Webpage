        <h1>Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) Algorithm</h1>
        <p>
            This algorithm is a modified version of the SCAN
            algorithm. C-SCAN sweeps the disk from end-to-end, but
            as soon it reaches one of the end tracks it then moves to
            the other end track without servicing any requesting
            location. As soon as it reaches the other end track it
            then starts servicing and grants requests headed to its
            direction. This algorithm improves the unfair situation of
            the end tracks against the middle tracks.
            <br><br>
            In the SCAN algorithm, the disk arm again scans the path that
            has been scanned, after reversing its direction. So, it may be
            possible that too many requests are waiting at the other end 
            or there may be zero or few requests pending at the scanned area.
            <br>
            These situations are avoided in the C-SCAN algorithm in which 
            the disk arm instead of reversing its direction goes to the other
            end of the disk and starts servicing the requests from there. So,
            the disk arm moves in a circular fashion and this algorithm is
            also similar to the SCAN algorithm hence it is known as C-SCAN (Circular SCAN).

            <h3>Advantages of C-SCAN Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Every request gets a fair chance to be served.</li>
                <li>Similar response times for all requests.</li>
                <li>Works well when the number of requests is high.</li>
                <li>Unlike SCAN, there is no back-and-forth motion, reducing seek time.</li>

            <h3>Disadvantages of C-SCAN Algorithm
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The jump from the highest to the lowest request adds extra head movement.</li>
                <li>It requires additional logic for circular movement.</li>
                <li>May not be the best choice if requests are scattered across the disk.</li>
